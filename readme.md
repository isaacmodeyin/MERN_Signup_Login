### Login and Registration using MERN Stack

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of user authentication with login and registration functionalities using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

The project includes:
- Backend server setup using Node.js and Express.
- MongoDB for data storage, with Mongoose for object modeling.
- API endpoints for user login and registration (`/login` and `/register`).
- Basic error handling and response messages for login and registration operations.

This setup allows for a simple yet functional user authentication system, suitable for learning purposes or as a starting point for more complex applications.
